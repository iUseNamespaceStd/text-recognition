# Requirements: 
* Install Tesseract-ocr engine from there: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
* Python 3.5 or above(with pip installed)
* Flask
* MySQL

## How to use?
Follow these steps:
1. Set the appropriate path for the location of Tesseract-OCR engine(tesseract.exe) inside the "ocr.py" script(path in script is the default path).
1. Inside the "app.py" file, make sure to "pip install" the required libraries. 
1. The format used inside the "customer_template.docx" file should remain the same unless you plan on changing the regex used inside the "app.py" file to a custom one. I recommend that you check out the regex first to learn about the appropriate format before filling in the cutomer_template.
1. To run the app, simply type "python app.py" inside the terminal.
1. Make sure that the image is located inside the 'static' folder to avoid errors before uploading.
1. From there, the application should be simple enough to use without the need for further explanation.
